This guide will show you how to read the SSL Certificate Information from a text-file on your server or from a remote server by connecting to it with the OpenSSL client.

Read the SSL Certificate information from a text-file at the CLI

If you have your certificate file available to you on the server, you can read the contents with the openssl client tools.

By default, your certificate will look like this.

$ cat certificate.crt
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIEzTCCA7WgAwIBAgISESHAjlbjcoBHxBYXS12oY6VjMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUA
...
CzgXBhDR3themzPx4jwx2ckNFpNDK/6yQgrKaHTewAAj
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

Which doesn't really tell you much.

However, you can decrypt that certificate to a more readable form with the openssl tool.

$ openssl x509 -text -noout -in certificate.crt 

It will display the SSL certificate output like expiration date, common name, issuer, ...

Here's what it looks like for my own certificate.

$ openssl x509 -text -noout -in certificate.crt 

Certificate:
...
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: C=BE, O=GlobalSign nv-sa, CN=AlphaSSL CA - SHA256 - G2
        Validity
            Not Before: Dec 16 20:01:40 2014 GMT
            Not After : Dec 16 20:01:40 2017 GMT
        Subject: C=BE, OU=Domain Control Validated, CN=ma.ttias.be
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                Public-Key: (2048 bit)
...

The openssl tools are a must-have when working with certificates on your Linux server.
Read the SSL Certificate information from a remote server

You may want to monitor the validity of an SSL certificate from a remote server, without having the certificate.crt text file locally on your server? You can use the same openssl for that.

To connect to a remote host and retrieve the public key of the SSL certificate, use the following command.

$ openssl s_client -showcerts -connect ma.ttias.be:443

This will connect to the host ma.ttias.be on port 443 and show the certificate. It's output looks like this.

$ openssl s_client -showcerts -connect ma.ttias.be:443

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIEzTCCA7WgAwIBAgISESHAjlbjcoBHxBYXS12oY6VjMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUA
...
CzgXBhDR3themzPx4jwx2ckNFpNDK/6yQgrKaHTewAAj
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
---
Server certificate
subject=/C=BE/OU=Domain Control Validated/CN=ma.ttias.be
issuer=/C=BE/O=GlobalSign nv-sa/CN=AlphaSSL CA - SHA256 - G2
---

There's many more output, like the intermediate CA certificates, the raw certificates (encoded) and more information on the ciphers used to negotiate with the remote server.

You can use it to find the expiration date, to test for SSL connection errors, ...
